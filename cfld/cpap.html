    <p>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is commonly prescribed to treat sleep apnea, a condition diagnosed via a sleep study. ... The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) can be a helpful measure to diagnose the severity of the condition at baseline and track the effectiveness of your treatment.
        Although many people are still using older CPAP machines, the newest machines offer wireless connectivity and allow users to monitor their own sleep therapy like never before. In particular, new CPAP machines monitor hours of use, apnea events, AHI(shallow breathing), mask leak, and provide maintenance reporting.
        Typical information stored on the machine's SD card or uploaded to the cloud include:

Days above 4 hours of usage

The patient's apnea/hypopnea index (AHI)

Leak rate of masks

Total blower hours
Total therapy hours
